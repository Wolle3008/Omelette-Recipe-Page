## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

When building this site I started using the whole content-area as only one container. Late into the project I realized it is problematic for the mobile solution, when only one part like the images should be full-width while the rest of the elements still has paddings/margins.
This made me realize I should probably separate future projects in a better way right from the start.
Second thing I learned was using table-tags in html so the nutrition part was semantic after all. First I tried the area with ```html <p>``` tags and with display of grid in css which made the borders easy for me to do.
After changing to a table in html I had to learn about the specific css for tables like border-collapse to make to nutrition page look like it should.
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

### Useful resources

- [Guide for table borders](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_table.asp) - This helped me to understand the border-collapse when using tables in HTML.
